    add a smoke test for #909
    
    with enough data to crash crossfilter if something is wrong
    with the ordering function. thanks @simon-stealthbits!

    Correction on #766, fixes #909
    
    running _computeOrderedGroups on the d3.stack data meant that the ordering
    function had to have a different signature from usual, peering into the
    inner `.data`.
    
    this was causing a crossfilter crash in IE (#909).
    
    so revert that and instead have `_ordinalXDomain` pluck the data and order
    that. slightly more efficient for the other uses of `flattenStacks` that
    don't need ordering, and actually correct.
